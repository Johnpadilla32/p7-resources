    "   Answer: $ \\Delta x\\approx$ 1720 m. By knowing the acceleration, time, intial velocity, and the constant acceleration motion equations, we can solve the question in a few easy steps. By using the formula $\\Delta x = v_i\\Delta t+ \\frac {1}{2}a\\Delta t^2 $, we can simply plug in the numbers to the variables. Since the intial velocity is equal to 0, the first part of the equation would also equal to 0. So now we are left off with $\\Delta x = \\frac {1}{2}a\\Delta t$"
